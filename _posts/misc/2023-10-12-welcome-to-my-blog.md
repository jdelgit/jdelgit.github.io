Welcome to my blog site, my name is {{ site.author.name }}. I've always been meaning to make one but just never got around to it. Over the years I've experemented with many different types of technologies in the field. During those sessions I've ran it to many issues which I end up resolving aftering banging my head against the issue for hours if not days and gleefully walk away with a resolved issue but no documentation for what I did.
With this blog I hope to more diligently keep track of those wonderful solutions and also share them with other poeple who may run into it in the future. So this blog is pretty much intented as a notebook for my solutions and the things I'm learning.

Should you come across anything interesting on this site you'd like to discuss or corrections/tips you may have on the topics covered I'd love to hear them.
Check out my [about](../about) page and hit me up.
